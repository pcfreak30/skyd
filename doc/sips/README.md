# SkIP Guidelines

People wishing to submit skyd Improvement Proposals (SkIPs) should first propose
their idea to the Skynet Labs Discord server. After discussion, please open a MR. After
copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a SkIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status
becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with
the consensus of the skyd users.
